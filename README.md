#Family Tree (SQL)

This was an exercise in SQL schema creation. I also constructed a record-accessing template
for each class to inherit.

Check out how the algorithms we use to traverse relationships, they're a lot of fun.

This application has a command line interface, just open `family_tree_interface.rb` with ruby.
